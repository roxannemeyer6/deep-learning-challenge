# deep-learning-challenge
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 

With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether 

applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

    EIN and NAME—Identification columns
    APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
    AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
    CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
    USE_CASE—Use case for funding
    ORGANIZATION—Organization type
    STATUS—Active status
    INCOME_AMT—Income classification
    SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
    ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
    IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively


Then, For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

    Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

    Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

    Data Preprocessing
        What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
        What variable(s) are the features for your model?
        What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

    Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
        How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
        Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
        What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

    Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
